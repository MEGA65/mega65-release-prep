The files available here are meant to be on the internal SD card for the MEGA65 release.
Important note: The order they are added is important for optimal speed on warm/cold boots etc.

Here is the order in which the files should be copied to a freshly fdisk'ed SD card - make
sure your OS does not write additional crap like System Information:

01. MEGA65.ROM
02. BANNER.M65
03. FREEZER.M65
04. C64THUMB.M65
05. C65THUMB.M65
06. ROMLOAD.M65
07. AUDIOMIX.M65
08. SPRITED.M65
09. MEGA651.ROM
10. MEGA652.ROM
11. MEGA650.ROM
12. MEGA65.D81
13. ONBOARD.M65
14. BASIC65.D81
15. GEOS.D81
16. ELEVEN.D81
17. SOLITAIR.D81
18. POPCORN.MOD
19. HEAVY.MOD

No other file should be on the SD card! Again, no deleting and re-adding for release image!

Note: This file (readme.md) won't make it to the card.
