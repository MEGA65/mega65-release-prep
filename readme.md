The files available here are meant to be on the internal SD card for the MEGA65 release.
Important note: The order they are added is important for optimal speed on warm/cold boots etc.

While this repository is good for testing, production cards shall only be written from an image provided by me.
This image has a) partitions generated by MEGA65 and b) priorities set for files like BANNER.M65 and MEGA65.ROM.

This file (readme.md) won't make it to the card.
